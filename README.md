## ChatShield

As part of our final year computer science project, we’re developing a Chrome extension that enhances user privacy on WhatsApp Web.
The extension automatically scans outgoing messages and alerts users when potentially sensitive or private content is detected before
it’s sent. The system combines client-side JavaScript with a Node.js backend and integrates NLP models from HuggingFace for real-time message
analysis. We're currently advancing the detection capabilities by adopting a hybrid architecture that merges multiple NLP models and fine-tunes
them using real-world conversational data to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
